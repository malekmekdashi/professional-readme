  ## Description
  This is a README.md generator. this project takes a somewhat annoying step of making a read me and turns it into a quick and easy process. not only is this method efficient, but it will also a generate a professional README. The first step I took to creating this application was installing the inquirer by typing in the command "npm i inquirer." To initiate the application, navigate to your terminal either in gitbash or the terminal in VS code and type in the command "node index.js." From there, we are prompted to answer a few basic questions. Once the questions have been answered, a new README.md will be created in the dist folder.
